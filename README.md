# SuperTaskSim
In philosophy, a supertask is a countably infinite sequence of operations that occur sequentially within a finite interval of time.[1] Supertasks are called "hypertasks" when the number of operations becomes uncountably infinite. A hypertask that includes one task for each ordinal number is called an "ultratask".[2] The term supertask was coined by the philosopher James F. Thomson, who devised Thomson's lamp. The term hypertask derives from Clark and Read in their paper of that name. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supertask

This supertask changes the background between red and green an infinite amount of times in 2 minutes theoretically, the first color change will take place at 1 minute and then the next at 30 seconds and so on until the 2 minute mark is reached.
